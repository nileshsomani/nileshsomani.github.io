# Nilesh Somani

Hey there! I'm a Software Engineer by profession. I've been playing around with computers since my 6th grade. Back in 90s computers were not that common in my small town(in India). I was just fasicanted after using one and that was the moment which motivated me to persue software development.

This is my first personal blog. I've been meaning to do this for a very long time but here it is now. Hope you like it.
